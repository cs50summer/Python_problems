# It breaks down an array into smaller subarrays, sorts them individually, and then merges 
# them back together to create a sorted array. The code includes two main functions: merge, 
# responsible for merging two subarrays, and mergeSort, which recursively divides and sorts 
# the array. The merge function combines two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array. 
# The mergeSort function recursively splits the array in half until each subarray has a single
#  element, then merges them to achieve the final sorted result.
