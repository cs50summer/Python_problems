#find all anagrams of s and store it in array

#logic to find all anagrams and store it
# for substrings of string from index 0 to n iterating combinations s[0:n]
# for example anagram of rat is 0,1,2 , 1,0,2 ,2,1,0 rat art tra , basically all permutations of the indexes
# for i in range len str

# find all anagrams of t and store it in an array
#compare anagrams of t and anagrams of s

def findAnagrams(s,t):
    print(set(s))

 #for i in range(len(s)):
 #    print(s.set())
